***********Difference*********


Data Control
GraphQL gives us more control over  data since it allows us to request exactly what we need in a single query. 
On the other hand, REST APIs are more limited in data control since each request needs to be tailored for the specific data being requested.

Speed & Efficiency
REST APIs are faster and more efficient since they can quickly return large amounts of data.
GraphQL is also fast but can be slower than a REST API if the requested data is complex or requires multiple requests.

Bandwidth Concerns
GraphQL also saves on bandwidth since it allows clients to request only the data they need in a single query. 
REST APIs require more requests, meaning they will use more bandwidth.

Set-up and Maintenance
REST APIs are easier to set up and maintain since they use standard protocols which are widely used.
GraphQL is more complicated to set up and maintain since it requires custom code and a GraphQL schema.


Rapid Prototyping
GraphQL is great for rapid prototyping since we can quickly query data and get the exact information you need in a single response.
REST APIs are better for complex applications that require more data manipulation

Error Handling
REST APIs tend to be better for error handling since they use standard protocols that are more easily monitored. 
They return various HTTP statuses for various API request states. GraphQL can make it complicated to monitor problems and integrate with necessary monitoring tools as the 200 Ok status is returned for every API request, even in cases of errors.


*****Limitations:**************


Fixed-structure data exchange
The REST API requires client requests to follow a fixed structure to receive a resource. 
but it’s not always the most efficient means to exchange exactly the data needed.

Overfetching and underfetching
REST APIs always return a whole dataset. For example, from a person object in the REST API, you would receive the person’s name, date of birth, address, and phone number. 
You would get all of this data even if you only needed a phone number.

Similarly, if you wanted to know a person’s phone number and last purchase, you would need multiple REST API requests.
 The URL /person would return the phone number and the URL /purchase would return purchase history.
